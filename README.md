### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Oliver Castellanos-Padilla (He/Him), I am a Data Scientist and ML/NLP Jr. Engineer!

I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a Data Scientist. Recently I have contributed hands-on to predictive analysis, machine learning, and data science-focused projects using Python and Flask to identify and compare global air quality statistics. Likewise, I recently completed a few independent projects using SQL with KNN and Tableau to improve game recommendations to potential users based on game reviews and critical insight analysis gathered from over 19 multinational video game development companies.



Feel free to review my posted project highlights or connect with me to learn more!



If you are looking for a driven and enthusiastic data scientist for your team, I would be thrilled to hear from you. Looking forward to growing my professional network and contributing to the next project!
